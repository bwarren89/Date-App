# San Jose Date Planner

San Jose Date Planner is a simple SwiftUI iOS app that helps you plan fun date itineraries around San Jose, California.

## Features

- Browse curated activities grouped by category
- View details about each activity including location and description
- Add activities to your date itinerary
- Manage your itinerary in a dedicated tab
- Smooth animations for adding items

This project provides a basic starting point. Open `SanJoseDatePlannerApp.swift` in Xcode to run the app and further customize the design and animations.

If you're on Linux you can still build the package to verify the models compile:

```bash
swift build
```

The Linux build uses a small command line stub because SwiftUI isn't available, but it ensures the core data model code compiles correctly.
